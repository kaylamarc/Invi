# Invi

Invi is an invoicing and inventory management program I wrote for my 2018-2019 Suncoast High School Senior Project.
- This project consisted of **AGILE project management with Scrum**. 


- NOTE: I would like to emphasize this was written in  _2018/2019_  so it may not be my best code, but it resembles my knowledge back then.


### The Project

Students were to individually find a real client (outside of family) to write a major software project for them. 
Students had to plan out their project, construct UML diagrams, create and complete weekly sprints, and follow AGILE and Scrum. The project began at the end of August 2018 and ended in April 2019.
In April 2019, **students presented the project in a professional manner in front of a panel of three judges, all of whom work in the industry.**
Students were judged on certain criteria within the project as well as the presentation itself.


From August 2018 to April 2019, I worked on my project individually with weekly scrum meetings. 
I spoke to a small buisiness owner in my hometown who had a hard time using accounting/invoicing software. 
After speaking to her about her issues with her current software and what she would like differently, I began to plan.
While visiting, I noticed that she did not keep inventory and when she recieved an order and didn't have that product she would just remake more.
So, to aid with that and to improve her efficiency, she agreed with my idea of the inventory system being included.
To which one of the main components of my project was for when an invoice were to be made, it took it out of the inventory in the database.
The main purpose of the software was to:
- Be more user friendly.
- To keep track of inventory.
- To be able to create and store invoices.


Upon completion of the project, there are a couple features that were not completed but were only supplementary features, not required by the client, I pushed to learn and try and implement.
I recieved an A+ grade for the project as well as some great feedback from the judges.
Unfortunately, in the time that I worked on the project, by the time I had my judging done, the client moved on to a different invoicing software and no longer needed mine. To which, the incomplete features have yet to be completed. (I may pick up and fix this project for fun in the future).


In hindsight, this project was a great learning experience in that I learned:
- Communicating with clients
- User Experience (UX)
- AGILE project management & Scrum
- Weekly Sprints
- UML
- and much more, as evident in the code.
